    <h3>What Are Wormholes?</h3>
    <p>Wormholes are hypothetical structures in spacetime that connect two distant points in the space. 
      Imagine a tunnel that shortens the journey between two places — this is what the concept of a wormhole offers. This idea originates from 
      Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, which allows for the existence of these "shortcuts" under certain conditions.</p>
    <h3>How Do Wormholes Work?</h3>
    <p>A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel piercing through spacetime. Its two ends, called "mouths," are connected by a narrow "throat." 
       If we could enter one end of the wormhole, we could instantly reach the other end, regardless of the distance separating these two points 
       in normal space. This means that wormholes could theoretically allow for travel over vast distances in a short period of time, and even 
       enable time travel.</p>
    <h3>Do Wormholes Really Exist?</h3>
    <p>Although wormholes are allowed by the mathematics of general relativity, there is no evidence of their actual existence. Another issue is 
       that most predicted types of wormholes would be unstable and collapse immediately after forming. For stable wormholes to exist, exotic 
       matter with so-called "negative energy" would be required, which has not yet been observed.</p>
    <h3>Significance and Potential Applications</h3>
    <p>Wormholes fascinate not only theoretical physicists but also science fiction creators. If they could be discovered or created, they could 
       revolutionize space travel, enabling quick movement between distant galaxies. Additionally, they might also make time travel possible, 
       opening entirely new possibilities for humanity — and potential paradoxes.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Wormholes remain one of the most intriguing concepts in physics. Although they are still only theoretical, their study inspires scientists 
       and writers, pushing the boundaries of our imagination and driving us toward a deeper understanding of the universe.</p>
